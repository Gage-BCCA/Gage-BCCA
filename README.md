# 🚀Participant in the Cyber Arms Race
Hey there, I'm Gage. I'm currently an IT Security Analyst and trying to make the jump into a security-focused software dev career. 

Currently, I am part of a small team that operates the SOC at one
of the largest paper manufacturing companies in the world. I have around 5 years of IT sysadmin experience, where I held the CompTIA Triad (A+, Net+, Sec+). The CISSP title is coming soon and I'm
plastering it everywhere afterward.

I want to position myself as a software engineer that focuses on security in both Web Applications and binaries/scripts that run on the underlying operating systems. I'm on the blue team, and I want to be an
expert in detecting and stop bad actors.

## 📘Education
I'm always in the market to learn something.

### 🕵️Coding
I'm attending Base Camp Coding Academy located in Water Valley, MS, where I'm learning lots of cool things:

- ☄️Full stack web development with popular back-end libraries and industry standard front-end coding practices
- 💻Proficiency in several languages and the foundational knowledge to quickly pick up others
- 👀Efficient Testing and Test-Driven Development
- 🌱Teamwork, project management, and a whole host of other soft skills

The program is incredibly cool, and I've met lots of working professionals starting their journey into tech.

### 🏰Security
I'm studying and plan to sit for my CISSP exam within the next few months. I'm always on top of security news and am always looking to be a better blue teamer.

### ❔Random Others
I have several platform-specific classes/courses/trainings, such as Sophos firewalls, random online classes like CS50x from Harvard, and of course, some self-study about math and programming. 

## 🧮Projects
Lots of projects for Base Camp in the pipeline.
