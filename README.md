# 🚀Participant in the Cyber Arms Race
Hey there, I'm Gage. I'm currently an IT Security Analyst that likes to code and wrangle data. Ex-cop and Ex-military. I hate (most) hackers.

Check out [my website](https://failedalgorithm.com) if you want to see some of my writings on random stuff.

### 🕵️Coding
I program in a variety of languages, but mostly Python and C#. I use PowerShell pretty often, too. I like data structures and discrete math. I especially enjoy:
- Backend and APIs
- Dealing with large datasets
- Making code efficient and saying the word "efficacy"

### 🏰Security
I'm a blue teamer who focuses on security initiatives and projects involving the digital security of my company. I push came here to push pencils and stop breaches -- and I'm all out of pencils.
